        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <P>
            Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent Indian nationalist leader who played a key role in the Indian
            independence movement against British rule. He was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, India.
        </P>
        <P>
            Bose was a brilliant student and obtained a degree in philosophy from the University of Calcutta. However,
            he was more interested in politics and joined the Indian National Congress in 1921. He soon rose to
            prominence within the Congress and was elected its president in 1938 and 1939.
        </P>
        <P>
            Bose disagreed with the Congress' nonviolent approach to achieving independence and formed the Forward Bloc
            in 1939. He then sought help from Germany and Japan during World War II to overthrow British rule in India.
            He formed the Indian National Army (INA) in collaboration with the Japanese and fought against the British
            in Burma and India.
        </P>
        <p>
            However, Bose's military campaign was unsuccessful, and he died in a plane crash in 1945, under mysterious
            circumstances.

                <h3><strong>1897–1921: Early life</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Subhash Chandra Bose, also known as Netaji, was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, India.
                    He was one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement against British rule.

                <h3><strong>1921–1932: Indian National Congress</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Subhash Chandra Bose was a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement against British
                    rule. He played a significant role in the Indian National Congress and advocated for a more militant
                    approach to the movement. He was elected as the mayor of Calcutta and implemented a number of
                    reforms during his tenure.

                <h3><strong>1941–1943: Collaboration with Nazi Germany</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    During 1941-1943, Subhash Chandra Bose collaborated with Nazi Germany to gain support for India's
                    independence movement. He formed the Indian Legion, a military unit made up of Indian prisoners of
                    war, and established a radio station in Germany to broadcast messages to India.

                <h3><strong>1943–1945: Japanese-occupied Asia</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    In Japan, he formed the Indian National Army, a military force made up of Indian soldiers who had
                    been captured by the Japanese. Bose's collaboration with the Axis powers was controversial, and he
                    faced criticism for his tactics.

                    Republic of China. He had been traveling to Japan from Bangkok, Thailand, when the plane crashed
                    shortly after takeoff.
